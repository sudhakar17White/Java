# Java

      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It 
      is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on 
      all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile


# Principles
  There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:

      It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
      It must be robust and secure.
      It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
      It must execute with high performance.
      It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
