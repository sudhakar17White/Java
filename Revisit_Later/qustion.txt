How to Attempt?
Count The Vowels:
Given a String input1 which is a single word of length n (n ranges from 1 to 20).
You have to find whether input1 contains all the vowels { a,e,i,o,u } in it and
all of them occurs only once. 
If both conditions satisfies, you need to remove those { a,e,i,o,u } from input1 and
return the output as "new word without {a,e,i,o,u } in it:length of the new word" . 
If any one of the vowel is not found or it occurs more than once, 
return the output as "reversed input1:ERROR".
Note:
1. input1 is always a single word with no spaces in it.
2. input1 will contain only lowercase alphabets.
3. output should be in uppercase.
 
Example - 1
input1: cauliflower
output: CLFLWR:6  
Explanation:  input1 has all the vowels { a,e,i,o,u } in it and everything occurs only once.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Example - 2
input1: arsenious
output: RSNS:4
Explanation: input1 has all the vowels { a,e,i,o,u } in it and everything occurs only once.
 
Example - 3
input1: caesiious
ouput: SUOIISEAC:ERROR
Explanation: input1 has all the vowels { a,e,i,o,u } in it but 'i' occurs twice.
 
Example - 4
input1: abcdaaaa
output: AAAADCBA:ERROR
